2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?

*Objects are important in javascript.
*Objects are different than primitive datatypes.
*Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key & value pair. 
*These keys can be variables or functions and methods.

Internal Representation:

*Window.document
*Document gets loaded into Window Object

examples of How we can use,

var details = new Object(); //this will create a new object

details.name = "fabian";

details.age = 21;

details.gender = "male";

Can be accessed by,

dot method:
console.log(details.name)//output:fabian
map method:
console.log(details[name])//output:fabian
